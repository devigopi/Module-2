## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ 1 to n Odd numbers in reverse order

###  Aim
To create a Python Program to print 1 to n Odd numbers in reverse order.

---

###  Algorithm

1. Begin the program.
2. Input a positive integer n.
3.Check if n is even:
  If yes, decrease n by 1 to make it odd.
4.Initialize a loop variable i with the value of n.
5.Loop while i > 0:
  Print the value of i.
  Decrease i by 2 (to move to the next smaller odd number).
6.Terminate the program.
